<h2>Program background</h2>
<p>In 1980, Kentucky raised its cap on weekly earnings that were covered by worker’s compensation. We want to know if this new policy caused workers to spend more time unemployed. If benefits are not generous enough, then workers could sue companies for on-the-job injuries, while overly generous benefits could cause moral hazard issues and induce workers to be more reckless on the job, or to claim that off-the-job injuries were incurred while at work.</p>
<p>The main outcome variable we care about is <code>log_duration</code> (in the original data as <code>ldurat</code>, but we rename it to be more human readable), or the logged duration (in weeks) of worker’s compensation benefits. We log it because the variable is fairly skewed—most people are unemployed for a few weeks, with some unemployed for a long time. The policy was designed so that the cap increase did not affect low-earnings workers, but did affect high-earnings workers, so we use low-earnings workers as our control group and high-earnings workers as our treatment group.</p>
<p>The data is included in the <strong>wooldridge</strong> R package as the <code>injury</code> dataset, and if you install the package, load it with <code>library(wooldridge)</code>, and run <code>?injury</code> in the console, you can see complete details about what’s in it. To give you more practice with loading data from external files, I exported the injury data as a CSV file (using <code>write_csv(injury, "injury.csv")</code>) and included it here.</p>
<p>These are the main columns we’ll worry about for now:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>durat</code> (which we’ll rename to <code>duration</code>): Duration of unemployment benefits, measured in weeks</li>
<li><code>ldurat</code> (which we’ll rename to <code>log_duration</code>): Logged version of <code>durat</code> (<code>log(durat)</code>)</li>
<li><code>after_1980</code> (which we’ll rename to <code>after_1980</code>): Indicator variable marking if the observation happened before (0) or after (1) the policy change in 1980. This is our <strong>time</strong> (or <em>before/after</em> variable)</li>
<li><code>highearn</code>: Indicator variable marking if the observation is a low (0) or high (1) earner. This is our <strong>group</strong> (or <em>treatment/control</em>) variable</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="load-and-clean-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Load and clean data</h2>
<p>First, let’s download the dataset (if you haven’t already), put in a folder named <code>data</code>, and load it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/data/injury.csv"><i class="fas fa-table"></i> <code>injury.csv</code></a></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)  # ggplot(), %&gt;%, mutate(), and friends
library(broom)  # Convert models to data frames
library(scales)  # Format numbers with functions like comma(), percent(), and dollar()
library(modelsummary)  # Create side-by-side regression tables</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Load the data. 
# It&#39;d be a good idea to click on the &quot;injury_raw&quot; object in the Environment
# panel in RStudio to see what the data looks like after you load it
injury_raw &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/injury.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Next we’ll clean up the <code>injury_raw</code> data a little to limit the data to just observations from Kentucky. we’ll also rename some awkwardly-named columns:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>injury &lt;- injury_raw %&gt;% 
  filter(ky == 1) %&gt;% 
  # The syntax for rename is `new_name = original_name`
  rename(duration = durat, log_duration = ldurat,
         after_1980 = afchnge)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory data analysis</h2>
<p>First we can look at the distribution of unemployment benefits across high and low earners (our control and treatment groups):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = injury, aes(x = duration)) +
  # binwidth = 8 makes each column represent 2 months (8 weeks) 
  # boundary = 0 make it so the 0-8 bar starts at 0 and isn&#39;t -4 to 4
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 8, color = &quot;white&quot;, boundary = 0) +
  facet_wrap(vars(highearn))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/diff-in-diff_files/figure-html/duration-histogram-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The distribution is really skewed, with most people in both groups getting between 0-8 weeks of benefits (and a handful with more than 180 weeks! that’s 3.5 years!)</p>
<p>If we use the log of duration, we can get a less skewed distribution that works better with regression models:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = injury, mapping = aes(x = log_duration)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = &quot;white&quot;, boundary = 0) + 
  # Uncomment this line if you want to exponentiate the logged values on the
  # x-axis. Instead of showing 1, 2, 3, etc., it&#39;ll show e^1, e^2, e^3, etc. and
  # make the labels more human readable
  # scale_x_continuous(labels = trans_format(&quot;exp&quot;, format = round)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(highearn))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/diff-in-diff_files/figure-html/log-duration-histogram-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We should also check the distribution of unemployment before and after the policy change. Copy/paste one of the histogram chunks and change the faceting:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = injury, mapping = aes(x = log_duration)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = &quot;white&quot;, boundary = 0) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(after_1980))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/diff-in-diff_files/figure-html/log-duration-before-after-histogram-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The distributions look normal-ish, but we can’t really easily see anything different between the before/after and treatment/control groups. We can plot the averages, though. There are a few different ways we can do this.</p>
<p>You can use a <code>stat_summary()</code> layer to have ggplot calculate summary statistics like averages. Here we just calculate the mean:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(injury, aes(x = factor(highearn), y = log_duration)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.2) +
  stat_summary(geom = &quot;point&quot;, fun = &quot;mean&quot;, size = 5, color = &quot;red&quot;) +
  facet_wrap(vars(after_1980))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/diff-in-diff_files/figure-html/plot-means-with-points-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>But we can also calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(injury, aes(x = factor(highearn), y = log_duration)) +
  stat_summary(geom = &quot;pointrange&quot;, size = 1, color = &quot;red&quot;,
               fun.data = &quot;mean_se&quot;, fun.args = list(mult = 1.96)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(after_1980))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/diff-in-diff_files/figure-html/plot-means-with-pointrange-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can already start to see the classical diff-in-diff plot! It looks like high earners after 1980 had longer unemployment on average.</p>
<p>We can also use <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarize()</code> to figure out group means before sending the data to ggplot. I prefer doing this because it gives me more control over the data that I’m plotting:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_data &lt;- injury %&gt;% 
  # Make these categories instead of 0/1 numbers so they look nicer in the plot
  mutate(highearn = factor(highearn, labels = c(&quot;Low earner&quot;, &quot;High earner&quot;)),
         after_1980 = factor(after_1980, labels = c(&quot;Before 1980&quot;, &quot;After 1980&quot;))) %&gt;% 
  group_by(highearn, after_1980) %&gt;% 
  summarize(mean_duration = mean(log_duration),
            se_duration = sd(log_duration) / sqrt(n()),
            upper = mean_duration + (1.96 * se_duration),
            lower = mean_duration + (-1.96 * se_duration)) 

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = highearn, y = mean_duration)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
                  color = &quot;darkgreen&quot;, size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(vars(after_1980))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/diff-in-diff_files/figure-html/plot-pointrange-manual-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Or, plotted in the more standard diff-in-diff format:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = after_1980, y = mean_duration, color = highearn)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), size = 1) + 
  # The group = highearn here makes it so the lines go across categories
  geom_line(aes(group = highearn))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/example/diff-in-diff_files/figure-html/plot-pointrange-manual-no-facet-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="diff-in-diff-by-hand" class="section level2">
<h2>Diff-in-diff by hand</h2>
<p>We can find that exact difference by filling out the 2x2 before/after treatment/control table:</p>

<th align="center">After 1980</th>

<p>A combination of <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarize()</code> makes this really easy:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>diffs &lt;- injury %&gt;% 
  group_by(after_1980, highearn) %&gt;% 
  summarize(mean_duration = mean(log_duration),

<p>We can pull each of these numbers out of the table with some <code>filter()</code>s and <code>pull()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>## [1] 0.19</code></pre>
<p>The diff-in-diff estimate is 0.19, which means that the program causes an increase in unemployment duration of 0.19 logged weeks. Logged weeks is nonsensical, though, so we have to interpret it with percentages (<a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/18639/3025">here’s a handy guide!</a>; this is Example B, where the dependent/outcome variable is logged). Receiving the treatment (i.e. being a high earner after the change in policy) causes a 19% increase in the length of unemployment.</p>

<h2>Diff-in-diff with regression</h2>
<p>Calculating all the pieces by hand like that is tedious, so we can use regression to do it instead! Remember that we need to include indicator variables for treatment/control and for before/after, as well as the interaction of the two. Here’s what the math equation looks like:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\log(\text{duration}) = &amp;\alpha + \beta \ \text{highearn} + \gamma \ \text{after_1980} + \\
&amp; \delta \ (\text{highearn} \times \text{after_1980}) + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> coefficient is the effect we care about in the end—that’s the diff-in-diff estimator.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>model_small &lt;- lm(log_duration ~ highearn + after_1980 + highearn * after_1980,
                  data = injury)

<p>The coefficient for <code>highearn:after_1980</code> is the same as what we found by hand, as it should be! It is statistically significant, so we can be fairly confident that it is not 0.</p>
</div>
<div id="diff-in-diff-with-regression-controls" class="section level2">
<h2>Diff-in-diff with regression + controls</h2>
<p>One advantage to using regression for diff-in-diff is that we can include control variables to help isolate the effect. For example, perhaps claims made by construction or manufacturing workers tend to have longer duration than claims made workers in other industries. Or maybe those claiming back injuries tend to have longer claims than those claiming head injuries. We might also want to control for worker demographics such as gender, marital status, and age.</p>
<p>Let’s estimate an expanded version of the basic regression model with the following additional variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>male</code></li>
<li><code>married</code></li>
<li><code>age</code></li>
<li><code>hosp</code> (1 = hospitalized)</li>
<li><code>indust</code> (1 = manuf, 2 = construc, 3 = other)</li>
<li><code>injtype</code> (1-8; categories for different types of injury)</li>
<li><code>lprewage</code> (log of wage prior to filing a claim)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important</em>: <code>indust</code> and <code>injtype</code> are in the dataset as numbers (1-3 and 1-8), but they’re actually categories. We have to tell R to treat them as categories (or factors), otherwise it’ll assume that you can have an injury type of 3.46 or something impossible.</p>

<p>After controlling for a host of demographic controls, the diff-in-diff estimate is smaller (0.17), indicating that the policy caused a 17% increase in the duration of weeks unemployed following a workplace injury. It is smaller because the other independent variables now explain some of the variation in <code>log_duration</code>.</p>
