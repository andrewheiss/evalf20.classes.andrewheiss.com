<p>Visit this section after you have finished the readings and lecture videos. It contains fully annotated R code and other supplementary information and it will be indispensable as you work on your problem sets and project.</p>
<p>Many sections also contain videos of me live coding the examples so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. You’ll notice me make all sorts of little errors, which <em>is totally normal</em>—everyone does!</p>
