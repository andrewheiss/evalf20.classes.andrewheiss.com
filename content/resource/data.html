<p>There are a ton of places to find data related to public policy and administration (as well as data on pretty much any topic you want) online:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural"><strong>Data is Plural newsletter</strong></a>: Jeremy Singer-Vine sends a weekly newsletter of the most interesting public datasets he’s found. You should subscribe to it. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0">He also has an archive of all the datasets he’s highlighted.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch"><strong>Google Dataset Search</strong></a>: Google indexes thousands of public datasets; search for them here.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets"><strong>Kaggle</strong></a>: Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions where people compete to create the fastest, most efficient, most predictive algorithms. A byproduct of these competitions is a host of fascinating datasets that are generally free and open to the public. See, for example, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">the European Soccer Database</a>, the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/salem-witchcraft-dataset">Salem Witchcraft Dataset</a> or results from an <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/oreo-flavors-tastetest-ratings">Oreo flavors taste test</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/data-registry/"><strong>360Giving</strong></a>: Dozens of British foundations follow a standard file format for sharing grant data and have made that data available online.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org/"><strong>US City Open Data Census</strong></a>: More than 100 US cities have committed to sharing dozens of types of data, including data about crime, budgets, campaign finance, lobbying, transit, and zoning. This site from the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org//">Code for America</a> collects this data and rates cities by how well they’re doing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Political science and economics datasets</strong>: There’s a wealth of data available for political science- and economics-related topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/briatte/srqm/wiki/Data"><strong>François Briatte’s extensive curated lists</strong></a>: Includes data from/about intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), public opinion surveys, parliaments and legislatures, wars, human rights, elections, and municipalities.</li>
