Here's your roadmap for the semester!

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the readings, slides, and recorded lectures for the topic. Read and watch these first.
- [**Example**](/example/) (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains fully annotated R code and other supplementary information that you can use as a reference for your assignments and project. This is only a reference pageâ€”you don't have to necessarily do anything here. Some sections also contain videos of me live coding the examples so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. This page will be *very* helpful as you work on your assignments.
- [**Assignment**](/assignment/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for each assignment. **Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the day they're listed.**
