<p>Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete <strong><em>before</em></strong> watching the lecture.</p>
<p>Every class session also has a YouTube playlist of short recorded videos for each of the lecture sections. The lecture slides are special HTML files made with the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html"><strong>xaringan</strong></a> (R can do so much!). On each class session page you’ll see buttons for opening the presentation in a new tab or for downloading a PDF of the slides in case you want to print them or store them on your computer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> View all slides in new window</span> <span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> Download PDF of all slides</span>
</p>
<p>The slides are also embedded on each page. You can click in the slides and navigate through them with <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>. If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while viewing the slides you can see a list of slide-specific commands (like <kbd>f</kbd> for fullscreen or <kbd>p</kbd> for presenter mode if you want to see my notes).</p>
