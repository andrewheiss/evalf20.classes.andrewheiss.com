Polio shots administered blindly with placebo - kids didn't know, doctor didn't know (double blind) - effect found

Why not just use those who didn't get a shot as the control group? Why placebo? Kids who opted out were poor (which actually had a lower incidence rate), so you can't compare them with the rich (which had higher incidence rate)

All drugs get the safety and efficacy requirement and double blind RCTs after that

No, this isn’t the greatest. Push for evidence-based practice can crowd out clinical judgment, which is valuable – we can’t ignore it or dismiss it

Doctors have seen things in the past. Lady Sybil in Downton Abbey and preeclampsia - family doctor knew more about the condition and Sybil—he had intuition and experience—but he was ignored

- RAND: In a large-scale, multiyear experiment, participants who paid for a share of their health care used fewer health services than a comparison group given free care. It concluded that cost sharing reduced "inappropriate or unnecessary" medical care (overutilization), but also reduced "appropriate or needed" medical care.
- Oregon: ongoing
- MTO: Researchers found that voucher recipients lived in lower-crime neighborhoods and generally had better units than the control group families, but the experiment had no impact on earnings or educational attainment. It did, however, have unexpected results in health and happiness. Parents in families who moved to low-poverty areas had lower rates of obesity and depression, and positive impacts on behavior and outlook among young women (but not young men)
- STAR: smaller class sizes lead to better outcomes

In the 1970s, experts were saying that reducing the drinking age would be fine - 26 states did - created a natural quasi-experiment for researchers - Cook then found that highway fatalities increase by 10% for 18–20-year-olds. That wouldn't have been possible without legislators inadvertently performing the experiment, paving the way for better science 

So knowledge flows between the two sides - use innovation from administrators as the basis for better science

Words of wisdom from @allison_horst to her data analysis class this quarter: You don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car safely, and you don't need to be a computer scientist or developer to use R safely. #rstats #tidytuesday

I always teach my students: there’s three levels of skill: driver, mechanic, engineer. You’re here to get your drivers license. But being able to change a tire can be helpful. Don’t worry not every one has to be an engineer. (I talk about R in social sciences)
