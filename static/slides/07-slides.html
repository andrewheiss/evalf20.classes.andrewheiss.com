**MTO** - main question = does your neighborhood matter?

Subtext = kids who grow up in poor neighborhood do worse - lots of theories about that. Problems reside in the family vs. something inherent in the neighborhood / social capital or other benefits inherent in the community (be in the network of people who know where the jobs for people with low education are)

Alternative explanations:

- Poor parents don't do well in the labor market, so they live in cheap neighborhoods, where they're surrounded by the same type of people
- Racism and discrimination

Randomly assign people to where they live - ideally from birth or even pre-birth - but families that we can possibly randomly assign already have kids (required for receiving public housing assistance)

So they randomly assign families in public housing who are willing to move and accept risk of having that move controlled - no other way to really do this - you'd have to pay middle-class and higher people a ton of money to get them to move

Then randomly assign them to (1) stay, (2) move to anywhere that would take voucher, (3) anywhere with less than 10% poverty rate + get relocation counseling

People were hoping to get option 2, since people already weren't choosing 3 - it's uncomfortable to move to a neighborhood where you don't fit in

.box-6[People might drop out because of the treatment,&lt;br&gt;or because they got/didn't get into the control group]

???

You don't have data on them. NA values. Even if people don't comply (like move to a private school), you can still get data on them, so that's okay. People might drop out randomly, and that would be fine. But if attrition is correlated with the treatment, then it's bad. People might drop because of the treatment, or because they didn't get the control group. Impossible to sign the bias—could be tons of different reasons.

.box-6.sp-after[Get participants invested in the experiment]

--

.box-inv-6.less-medium[Collect as much baseline information as possible]

.box-6[Check for randomization of attrition]

???

- Recruit as effectively as possible (so you don't get volunteers that routinely sign up for randomized experiments). Use money for recruitment

- Get people on board. Treatment might be less/more enjoyable than the control group, so people will feel lucky or unlucky to be in the treatment group - explain why the experiment itself is important. Make them invested in getting the experiment to work. Science! Why you want the right answer beyond whether or not the treatment works

- Collect as much baseline information as possible before assigning to treatment and control groups - doesn't help reduce attrition like getting people on board, but it lets us see if attrition is random with respect to preexisting characteristics - checks for randomization failures. Don't rerandomize. Randomize and then suck it up.

MTO varied income, not race, since it's illegal to tell people they can only move to a white neighborhood. So they used income instead of race. Keys under the light issue, since the original issue was about race

Scalability issue with STAR. It wasn't hard to hire 40 more teachers in TN. California couldn't find enough teachers, so they emergency certified "a bunch of morons," which messed up the program effect

# When to randomly assign

--

.box-inv-6[When people won't know (and it's ethical!)]

--

.box-inv-6[When lotteries are going to happen anyway]

???

- When demand for treatment exceeds supply or treatment must be phased in over time (instead of doing the closest place first, etc.)
- When people don't know what they want to do = equipoise (medical trials have to be in equipoise - unethical to use a treatment that's clearly beneficial)
- When the local culture is favorable to random assignment - prime people to be more comfortable with it
- When you are a nondemocratic monopoly provider - if you're the only one with the treatment, you decide who gets it - like Google and Facebook and A/B testing
- When people won't know (as long as it's ethical) - resume name experiments, e-mails to politicians
- When lotteries are going to happen anyway
